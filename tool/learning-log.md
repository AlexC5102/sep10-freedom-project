Things I Tried and Progress Made
<ul>
<li>Started with the basic setup of A-Frame, including creating my first scene using <a-scene>, <a-box>, and <a-sphere>.<li>
Experimented with adding textures to 3D objects. I managed to apply a simple image as a texture on the box, enhancing my understanding of the aesthetics.
Successfully integrated animations into my scene using the built-in A-Frame animation component, which allowed me to create a spinning effect for my box.
Explored using ambient light and directional light, realizing how it impacts the overall feel of my scene.
</ul>
