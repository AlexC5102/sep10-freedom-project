# Entry 2: Deciding my topic (Business)
##### 11/4/24
### Context
I am now learning about CSS in unit 1 and recently I have been gatherning infomation of softwares + hardwares technologies on Business for my <b>Freedom Project</b>. Where I went on google to search up what types of hardwares and softwares are included when it comes to business where it gave me several softwares/hardwares to chose from. During my search I found a hardware that is used in a business which was <b>SERVERS</b> which provides resources, data, services, or programs to other computers, known as clients, over a network. This hardware can be used in businesses where a server in your business can centralizes your business information and help you work more efficiently.
### How are these Softwares/Hardware used?
The Softawres/Hardwares that I have researched are used in Businesses everyday whcih without these business wouldn't get any income.
