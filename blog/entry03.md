# Entry 3: Brainstorming Ideas for the Future
##### 12/18/24

Content: During our time doing our freedom project we decided to move on from part A to part B where we were assigned to think of inventions or ideas based on our topics that doesn't exist yet and how they function. This page will enhance your understanding of how businesses can use technology and how using technology that doesn’t exist yet to make their business go up. We can use these future technology to help with both parts: robotics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, augmented reality, computer architecture, operating systems, front-end vs back-end, algorithms, databases, etc.

# **Some of the ideas that I've came up with:**
**Fin Coin**

A cryptocurrency (a virtual currency) designed to act as money and a form of payment outside the control of any one person, group, or entity. A form of digital currency that uses blockchain technology to support transactions between users on a decentralized network
You can buy a home with cryptocurrency using RealOpen's crypto-to-fiat service. The platform allows you to purchase any property—whether on-market or off-market—using Fincoin, Ethereum, USDC, and other marketable cryptocurrencies.

# **EDP**

Bitcoin and other cryptographic currencies have gained attention over the years as the systems continue to evolve. This course looks at the design of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and how they function in practice, focusing on cryptography, game theory, and network architecture.

**Some other Ideas:**

- Smart table -
This device is a table with a huge smart screen on it where you can control the whole thing with a remote or your computer. It's another form of handing your clients or members about the new set of information you’ve thought of.
This can project what you will be talking about to everyone at the table just in case there could be someone who can’t see and has no idea what you are talking about then the table would show them the piece of information they lacked.
This can allow you to access information at your pace and no need to rush though the meeting and not understand anything. 

- AI chatbot -
This AI will speak to customers and provide information and support 24/7 where if the customers get confused the AI will automatically find a solution to the problem.
a computer program that simulates human conversation through voice commands or text chats or both
an artificial intelligence (AI) feature that can be embedded and used through any major messaging application.

**Why these inventions are important**

Inventions improve our lives in many ways. They make our tasks easier, entertain us, improve our knowledge of the world, and even save lives. Think about it: Make a list of inventions that make your life easier, better or simply more fun and also Inventions can lead to new technologies, create new jobs, and improve quality of life.
