# Presentation Plan

## Hook
* See how apps and smart tools can help your business grow it's easier than you think.

## Product
* Overview: I'll explain in this website includes technology that is changing businesses overall
* Apps: "I included tools like Slack, Paypal, and Zoom which are common in real-world businesses"
* Software & Hardware: These sections explains servers and communication tools businesses rely on and why
* Innovations: I imagined 5 future tech ideas, like smart tables and auto translation devices to make work even easier
* 3d Model: Here's a 3d sence of showing how auto translation glasses might looks using Aframe

## Process
Tools that I used
* HTML	(Structure of the website)
* CSS	(Colors, fonts, layout)
* Bootstrap	(Card design and responsive layout) I used Bootstrap to help me design cards and responsive layouts. This made the website look cleaner on phones and desktops.
* A-Frame	(3D model of translation glasses) I used A-Frame to create a 3D model of my translation glasses. I used simple shapes (like boxes and rings).
* Google Fonts	(Custom font style) I added custom colors, fonts, and spacing to match my theme. I used the Itim font and changed the background color to brown and beige tones.
* Images	(To visually explain each idea)

## Conclusion
* 

<!-- EXAMPLE

## Hook
* Verbal riddle of GGD

## Product
* GIF/Demo of example/non-example

## Process
* Flowchart of plan
  * MVP: noun -> door -> yes/no
  * Beyond MVP: noun -> word relation API -> noun API -> yes/no, with counterexample
* Code snippets of:
  * MVP
  * Both APIs
  * Challenge with API keys

## Conclusion
* [URL to project]
* Takeaways
  * Less = more: the heart of the riddle was one line of code; it obviously took more to make the entire thing work, but one complicated line of regular expressions was essentially the solution to the riddle
  * Expect the unexpected: it’s important to budget time for things you don’t account for; for example, I didn’t consider the fact that I would need another entire API to detect nouns
  * Determination is key: ironically enough, I had to make my API keys private. At first, it didn’t seem like it was possible, which meant I couldn’t publish my app. But after all of that hard work, I was determined to find a solution, and I found it in config variables.
* "Presentation can’t, but a speech can"
